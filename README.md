### **Basic application functionality**
***
- routing
- page 404
- preloader functionality
- dynamic generation of a list of the cards with elements from the database (Christmas decorations with descriptions)
- the ability to search for a card by name (at the beginning of text entry in the **Search for toys** field)
- the ability to add a new toy card to the database after clicking on the **+ Add toy** button
- hovering over the card allows to get additional functionality:
  - data editing, pushing a button with a pencil
  - card deleting from the data-base, pushing a button with a bucket
> obviously the last 3 actions should be restricted by access rights, which will be implemented soon
